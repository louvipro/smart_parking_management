# ðŸš— Parking Management System with AI Agent

A web application built with Python 3.12 that manages a parking system lifecycle and includes an AI conversational agent for querying parking data.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Vehicle Entry/Exit Management**: Track vehicles with timestamps and automatic spot assignment
- **Payment Calculation**: Automatic fee calculation based on parking duration
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor parking occupancy and availability
- **Multi-floor Support**: Manage parking spots across multiple floors with different spot types (regular, disabled, VIP)

### AI Conversational Agent
The AI-powered chatbot can answer queries like:
- "How many blue cars are currently in the parking?"
- "How much money have we generated in the last hour?"
- "How many cars are currently parked?"
- "What's the average daily number of cars using the parking?"
- "What's the average daily spending per user?"
- "What's the average parking duration for black cars?"

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12**
- **Streamlit** - Web framework for the dashboard
- **FastAPI** - Backend API server
- **CrewAI** - AI agent system for natural language queries
- **LiteLLM** - Unified interface for multiple LLM providers
- **SQLAlchemy** - Database ORM with async support
- **Pydantic** - Data validation
- **Docker** - Containerization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd parking-management-system
```

2. **Create environment file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
make install-prod
```

4. **Run the application**

Option A: With local LLM (Ollama)
```bash
# Install and start Ollama
make install-ollama
make run-ollama

# Download the model
make download-ollama-model

# Run the application
make run-app
```

Option B: With OpenAI or other providers
```bash
# Edit .env file and set:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
# OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo

# Run the application
make run-app
```

5. **Access the application**
- Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
- FastAPI docs: http://localhost:8080/docs

## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start:
- Parking management system (Streamlit + FastAPI)
- Ollama for local LLM support

### Building Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t parking-management-system .
docker run -p 8501:8501 -p 8080:8080 parking-management-system
```

## Usage

### 1. Parking Dashboard
Navigate to the Parking Dashboard to:
- Register vehicle entries with license plate, color, and brand
- Process vehicle exits and calculate payments
- View real-time parking status
- Monitor floor-wise occupancy

### 2. AI Assistant
Use the AI Assistant to:
- Ask natural language questions about parking data
- Get insights on revenue and occupancy
- Query vehicle statistics by color or brand
- Analyze parking patterns

### 3. API Endpoints
The FastAPI backend provides REST endpoints:
- `POST /api/parking/entry` - Register vehicle entry
- `POST /api/parking/exit` - Process vehicle exit
- `GET /api/parking/status` - Get parking status
- `GET /api/parking/analytics/*` - Various analytics endpoints

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key configuration options in `.env`:
- `DEV_MODE` - Enable debug logging
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - LLM provider API key
- `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` - Model to use (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, ollama/qwen2.5)
- `HOURLY_RATE` - Parking fee per hour

### Database
The system uses SQLite by default. For production, configure PostgreSQL:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
ASYNC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/dbname
```

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**: User interface for parking operations and AI chat
2. **Backend (FastAPI)**: REST API for parking management
3. **Database (SQLAlchemy)**: Data persistence with async support
4. **AI Agent (CrewAI)**: Natural language processing for queries using AI agents with tools
5. **Services Layer**: Business logic for parking operations and analytics

### Data Models
- **Vehicle**: Stores vehicle information (license plate, color, brand)
- **ParkingSpot**: Represents individual parking spaces
- **ParkingSession**: Tracks vehicle entry/exit and payments

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
make test
```

### Code Quality
```bash
make pre-commit  # Run linting and formatting
```

### Adding New Features
1. Add models in `src/database/models.py`
2. Create Pydantic schemas in `src/schemas/`
3. Implement business logic in `src/services/`
4. Add API endpoints in `src/api/routers/`
5. Create UI components in `src/pages/`
